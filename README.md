# Artifact Repository ASE 2022 - Neuroevolution-Based Generation of Tests and Oracles for Games

# Repository Structure

The repository consists of three main directories:

- **Dataset** contains all the games and generated tests that were used to produce the presented results. Have fun
  playing the games yourself using the [Scratch Website](https://scratch.mit.edu)!
- **Neatest** contains the software artifact and scripts to reproduce the results presented in the paper.
- **Results** contains the raw results presented in the paper and python scripts to plot them. 

Further information about each directory can be found in a README file located in the corresponding directory.

This repository is tailored to the **Neatest** tool and does not contain all features of the **Whisker** testing framework.
Please refer to the [Whisker repository](https://github.com/se2p/whisker), for newer versions of **Neatest** and more diverse Scratch testing approaches.
