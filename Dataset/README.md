# Dataset

The Dataset directory contains the following two subdirectories:

- **Games** contains the Scratch games that were used as test subjects during the evaluation. If you'd like to
  have a look at them or play them yourself, head to
  the  [Scratch website](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=getStarted) and load a Scratch `.sb3` file
  via `File -> Load from your computer`. The `DatasetStats.csv` file lists statistics about the various test subjects,
  such as the number of sprites in a given program.
- **TestSuites** contains the test suites that were generated during RQ1 and used for evaluating RQ2.
