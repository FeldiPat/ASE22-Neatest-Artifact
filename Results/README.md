# Results

The Results directory consists of the following subdirectories:

- **PaperResults** contains the raw data reported in the paper as `.csv` files.
- **GeneratedResults** contains the results of the reproduction scripts residing in the Neatest directory.
- **PlotScripts** contains Python scripts for plotting the raw paper results. Execute the `plotPaperResults.sh` script to plot the results of all three RQs at once.
- **Plots** contains plotted results after executing one of the plot scripts in the **PlotScripts** directory.

Due to space limitations, we excluded the generated logs of RQ1, which are required to count the number of reached winning states. If you are interested in these logs, please contact us.
